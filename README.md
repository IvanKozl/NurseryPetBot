# NurseryPetBot
This is a telegram bot that will be able to answer popular questions from people about what you need to know and be able to pick up an animal from a shelter, as well as provide a report on how animals adapt to a new environment.
We are a young development team consisting of 4 people: Ivan, Masha and Vladislav. We have a working telegram bot with limited functionality at https://t.me/NurseryCatDogBot .
At the moment we are working on improving its component and plans for its implementation can be viewed on our workboard: https://www.notion.so/13b0993599f84843ba9e21dd53785742?pvs=4 .
